Numpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array
and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays.
SciPy builds on this, and provides a large number of functions
that operate on numpy arrays and are useful for different types of
scientific and engineering applications.
- Image Operations
- Distance between points
