Bayesian inference uses probability distributions as building blocks for specifying models. They are used to assign uncertainty to unknown parameters, or sampling distributions to data.






https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/README.html#purpose

Purpose
- PyMC is a python module that implements Bayesian statistical models and fitting algorithms, including Markov chain Monte Carlo. Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems. Along with core sampling functionality, PyMC includes methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence diagnostics.

Features
- Fits Bayesian statistical models with Markov chain Monte Carlo and other algorithms.
- Includes a large suite of well-documented statistical distributions.
- Uses NumPy for numerics wherever possible.
- Includes a module for modeling Gaussian processes.
- Sampling loops can be paused and tuned manually, or saved and restarted later.
- Creates summaries including tables and plots.
- Traces can be saved to the disk as plain text, Python pickles, SQLite or MySQL database, or hdf5 archives.
- Several convergence diagnostics are available.
- Extensible: easily incorporates custom step methods and unusual probability distributions.
- MCMC loops can be embedded in larger programs, and results can be analyzed with the full power of Python.
